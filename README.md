# JavaFX-TaskRocket


TaskRocket is a JavaFX based desktop application that allows users to "gamify" their real life tasks. Users can sign up and log in, and once logged in, they can add tasks. Once they have added tasks, they can choose to do those tasks, for a set timer. If they manage to complete the timer alloted for that task, they gain experience points or "XP." With enough XP, users are able to level. Users can also conduct "group tasks" with other existing users and gain group-wise XP. They can also delete tasks and view their own location.

Overall, TaskRocket is a CRUD management application for managing your day to day task. It adds a bit of a twist by gamifying the entire experience.
